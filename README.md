# LambdaArchitecture
## This is an implementation of Lambda Architecture uisng Spark on Scala with Kafka and Cassandra.   

Data is generated by Log producer, which acts as a Kafka Producer.   
There is a speed layer which reads data from Kafka (acting as a consumer), which commits it to HDFS for processing by Batch layer. 
It also performs quick analysis on the data and pushed to Cassandra tables.   

The Batch layer runs every 6 hours and processes the data from HDFS, performs analysis and writes to Cassandra providing a full view of the data.  

Additional things used: DStreams, Parquet files, Offset management, Direct Streams and Receiver based, RDD operations on DStreams, 
creation, read and write into Cassandra.
